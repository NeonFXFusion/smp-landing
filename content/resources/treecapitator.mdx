The Treecapitator is a feature of an Axe that can break all connected logs of a tree allowing for easier farming of wood.


## Features 

- Let users destroy entire trees by breaking only 1 log. Even the biggest tree will fall!
- Works on nether trees.
- It also destroys all leaves around.
- Switch on/off if an axe is required and/or damaged.
- Each player can toggle on/off the plugin for themselves.
- Axes are damaged accordingly.
- Crouch mode. Use true in this configuration so that crouching players not trigger this plugin.

Using /tc toggle in the game will disable or enable this feature.
